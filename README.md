How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

After consulting with the client, and visualising the client's needs and wants I implented and revised over many times.

Optimizations
I would like to implement react to make the website a bit more dynamic. Possibly add googleOAUTH for customers to be able to sign up and log in for convience.

Lessons Learned:
I definitely learn that communication is a huge essential part of delivering what the client wants as well as making the project as smooth as possible without underdoing some thing or overdoing some thing. You may think adding more features might be something awesome, however, if it's not in the client's vision, then you are not delivering what the client needs.
